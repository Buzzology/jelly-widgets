- Subscriptions to sign up to page (list of purchase choices instead of only 7.50$ month) - see the apps tab in slack for design layout. This may work for adding widgets as well

- Add widget search not wired up
- Create landing page
- Create explainer tours (use redux)
- Create user account/profile

- Default load of first dashboard
